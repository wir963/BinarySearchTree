BinarySearchTree
================

This is my binary search tree project from my Data Structures class in the Fall of 2012 at Georgetown University taught by Professor Montgomery.

To run: 
cd into BinarySearchTree directory
make // to run the makefile
./bSTDriver INT.txt // to run the program using the provided list of integers
./bSTDriver CHAR.txt // to run the program using the provided list of chars

The program will output the contents of the tree in pre-order and in-order (which will be sorted). It can also print in post-order.

The Binary Search Tree is parameterized and works with the included CHAR and INT classes and would work for anything other classes that implement the necessary methods.
